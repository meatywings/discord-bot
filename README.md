# Discord Bot

## TODO
 - [ ] Change over from the sounds.json to a database.
 - [ ] Add ability for users to upload their own sound clips
	- should these be downloaded or just used as links?
 - [ ] Make 'rules' seperate files that act as listeners or 'subsribers' to messages. This allows to have multiple 'rules' processing the same message.
